# Turing-Back
An interesting mini-program presenting a collision between history, AI, and humor.

Based on answers to several strange, logical or emotional questions, the program will "rate" whether the user is human or AI.

"Rating" mechanism:

- Each answer is rated on a scale of 1 to 5 as more "human" or more "AI-like".

- Finally, the program displays the result.

Technical implementation in Visual Basic.
